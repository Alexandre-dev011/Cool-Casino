# Secret Casino Game

Welcome to the Secret Casino Game! This is a simple, text-based casino game that lets you play three different games: **Dice**, **Roulette**, and **Blackjack**. Try your luck and see if you can beat the house while managing your balance!

## Features
- **Dice Game**: Roll a dice and double your bet if you roll 1, 2, or 3. If you roll 4, 5, or 6, you lose your bet.
- **Roulette Game**: Bet on a number or on whether the result will be even or odd. Win big if your number matches the roulette result!
- **Blackjack Game**: Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Face cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth 1 or 11.

## How to Play
1. **Start the game**: Run the script, and you will be greeted with the main menu to choose between the three available games.
2. **Choose your game**: 
    - **Dice**: Bet any amount of money and roll the dice. Try to get a low number to win!
    - **Roulette**: Bet on a specific number (0-36) or whether the number will be odd or even.
    - **Blackjack**: Try to beat the dealer by getting a hand value closest to 21 without going over.
3. **Manage your balance**: You begin with a balance of $1000, and you can lose or win money based on your bets. Keep an eye on your balance!
